        <p>I met my girlfriend on New Years Day 2018 and it has been a very special day since I first saw her.  I fell in love with her and it was the most beautiful day of my life.  We danced all night and didn't feel the time at the time.  I'm really grateful for that beautiful coincidence</p>

        <p>After spending a whole year with each other, we decided to move to my house together. I cannot live without her anymore. I cannot wake up in the morning without seeing her narcissistic face, so it was a good decision and we are very happy in our new home.</p>
